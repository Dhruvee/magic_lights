# Magic Lights
###**Summary** 
The basic concept is to have a setup change color depending on the movement in the finger. A *flex sensor* will be worn in the hand and depending on the input from the sensor, the lights will be programmed to change color.


###**Component Parts**
1. Neopixel Strip LED's
2. 2 Flex sensors
3. Circuit components(Arduino, wires, resistors, etc.)
4. RF Transmitter, receiver

###**Challenges**
Communication between the arduino's.
Getting the right color for the LED's.


###**Project Timeline**
* *WEEK 1* : Determining the configuration of LED’s and building glove/remote

* *WEEK 2*: Working on coding to link LED’s and glove to Arduino

* *WEEK 3*: Working on coding to go from input to output

* *WEEK 4*: Working on coding to go from input to output

* *WEEK 5*: Setup
