# magic_lights
##**Summary** 
The basic idea is to create an atmosphere, a room for example, with LED’s that **act magical**! All attributes of the LED's such as brightness, flickering/blinking movements, or even just the on and off will be manipulated. This will create a fantastical space where the *user can control all the light in the room* and play around with that. It could also be used in high-end choreographed performances where the artists can control the ambience too in addition to all the other things.

The LED’s will be controlled via a **wearable remote glove**. A *flex sensor* will be installed in each of the fingers of the glove. Depending on how far or how much the finger is moved or flexed, the input from the flex sensor, after going through a program, will manipulate the LED’s. 


##**Component Parts**
1. LED's
2. Hand Glove
3. Flex sensors
4. Circuit components(Arduino, wires, resistors, etc.)


##**Challenges**
Figuring out how the input from the sensor relates to the output in the LED’s. For example, what value of the sensor, and which sensor, does what, and to which LED’s.


##**Project Timeline**
1.*WEEK 1* : Determining the configuration of LED’s and building glove/remote
2.*WEEK 2*: Working on coding to link LED’s and glove to Arduino
3.*WEEK 3*: Working on coding to go from input to output
4.*WEEK 4*: Working on coding to go from input to output
5.*WEEK 5*: Setup
